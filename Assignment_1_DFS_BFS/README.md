# Homework Assignment: DFS and BFS Algorithms

## Description
This homework assignment is given by Istanbul Technical University and focuses on the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The goal of the assignment is to implement these algorithms and analyze their performance on various graph structures.

## Contents
1. Implementing the DFS algorithm in C++ using its modern features effectively.
2. Implementing the BFS algorithm in C++ using its modern features effectively..
3. Testing the implementation by using Calico helper library
4. Analizing the time and space complexity of both algorithms.


## Resources
- [DFS Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- [BFS Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

## Additional Notes
- Each text file contains a map and a resource type given in each node.
- Main goal of the assignment is to find the largest colonies with the same resource type and printing them in order.
